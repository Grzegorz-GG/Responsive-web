# Responsive-web
Sample single-page responsive website for a "fake" company. Technologies used :
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>JS/jQuery</li>
</ul> 
<br>
<p>
  Website can adjust to various screen sizes. For mobile devices it has a different menu type (a kind of "dropdown" list). Many jQuery effects (like "carousel" picture viewer, slider for team member pictures) were also added.
